        <p>Most people start off with little or low self-confidence, but as a result of their own efforts, 
            they become bold and brave and outgoing. And we’ve discovered that if you do the same things that other 
            self-confident men and women do,
             you, too, will experience the same feelings and 
             get the same results.
             <em>The key is to be true to yourself, to be true to the very best that is in you, 
             and to live your life consistent with your highest values and aspirations</em>.
             Take some time to think about who you are and what you believe in and what is important to you.
             Decide that you will never compromise your integrity by trying to be or say or feel something that is not true for you.             
             Have the courage to accept yourself as you really are—not as you might be, or as someone else thinks you should be—and know that, 
             taking everything into consideration, you are a pretty good person.             
             After all, we all have our own talents, skills, and abilities that make us extraordinary.
